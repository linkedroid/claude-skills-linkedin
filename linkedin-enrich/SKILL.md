# Bulk LinkedIn URL Enrichment

Given N LinkedIn profile URLs, this skill returns enriched data: current role, company, location, experience timeline, skills, and email when findable. Output as a markdown table, CSV, or JSON.

## Required prerequisites — check before you start

1. **`linkupapi` MCP connected.** Verify with `linkupapi_list_accounts`.
   - If the list is **empty**, tell the user they have two options to connect a LinkedIn account, then stop and wait:
     - **Hosted UI** — open https://app.linkupapi.com/account-connection (fastest, handles checkpoints in-browser).
     - **MCP login** — run `linkupapi_login` directly (platform=linkedin, with email+password OR a `login_token`). On `checkpoint_required` → run `linkupapi_checkpoint`.
2. **Pick the sending account** before Stage 1. After confirming at least one `status = connected` account exists, present the connected accounts via `AskUserQuestion` (single-select). Each option label is the account display name; description shows email + country. The chosen `account_id` is used for the `linkedin_profiles get` calls in Stage 2 (which consume the 100 profile gets / day cap on that account). The `linkupapi_enrich` actions (`find_email`, `validate_email`) don't require an `account_id` — they use LinkUp's managed pipeline.
3. A list of LinkedIn URLs from the user (inline, file path, or copy-paste).

## Daily LinkedIn safety caps (MANDATORY — enforced)

- **100 profile gets / day** — hard ceiling for this skill
- 15 searches/day — not relevant (no search calls)
- 20 invites/day — not relevant (no invites)

**Before Stage 1**, run `linkupapi_get_logs` for last 24h on the chosen account, count today's `linkedin_profiles/get`. The skill enriches only `min(N, 100 - already_used_today)`. If user provides 50 URLs but 80 profile gets are already used today, enrich the 20 most-prioritized and defer the rest.

If `linkupapi_get_logs` is unavailable, fall back to scanning today's `./campaigns/*.md` and `./enrichments/*.md` for `linkedin_profiles/get` evidence and counting.

## Stage 0 — Collect input

`AskUserQuestion`:

1. **URL source**:
   - Paste list inline (one URL per line)
   - Path to a file (`.csv` / `.txt` / `.md` — agent reads via `Read`)
2. **Email enrichment**: yes / no
3. **Validate emails**: yes / no (recommended yes for paid lists)
4. **Output format**:
   - Markdown table inline (default for ≤50 URLs — readable in chat)
   - CSV file → `./enrichments/{date}-{slug}.csv`
   - JSON file → `./enrichments/{date}-{slug}.json`
5. **Output fields** — checkboxes:
   - Always: name, current title, current company, location, headline
   - Optional: industry, full experience timeline, skills, education, profile_picture_url
   - If email enabled: email, validation status

Echo the plan with daily-cap math:
```
URLs provided:           50
URLs after dedupe:       47
Profile budget today:    100 used / 100 cap → 0 remaining 🚫 STOP
                                  OR
Profile budget today:    20 used / 80 remaining → enrich up to 47 ✓

Output format:           CSV → ./enrichments/2026-04-27-leads-batch-1.csv
```

Wait for "yes" before continuing.

## Stage 1 — Parse and dedupe URLs

Extract the LinkedIn handle from each URL (`/in/<handle>` or `/in/<handle>/`). Drop:
- Duplicates (same handle)
- `/company/` URLs (this skill is profiles only — surface them in a separate "skipped: company URLs" list)
- `LinkedIn Member` anonymized URLs (URL contains `headless`) — cannot be enriched
- URL-encoded paths — extract raw handle (decode percent-encoding)

Show the user the parsed count vs original. If >20% were dropped, ask for confirmation before continuing (likely a bad input list).

## Stage 2 — Profile enrichment

Tool: `linkedin_profiles get` with `identifier=<handle>`, sequential with **2-3s sleep** between calls (longer than outreach skill — bulk enrichment patterns are more closely watched by LinkedIn).

**HARD CAP** at remaining 100/day budget. If reached mid-run, save partial results, mark remaining as "deferred to tomorrow", and stop gracefully.

For each profile, extract per the user's chosen output fields. Always capture:
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `headline`
- `experience[0].company` → `current_company`
- `experience[0].title` → `current_title`
- `experience[0].company_url` → derive `company_domain` for email lookup (extract last path segment of LinkedIn company URL → match against known domain registry, OR pass the company name to email finder)
- `location`, `industry`

Mark a profile as `enrichment_failed` (not budget-exhausted) if the API returns 404 / private / member-removed. Don't retry.

## Stage 3 — Email enrichment (if requested)

Tool: `linkupapi_enrich` action `find_email`.

**Mode A — by LinkedIn URL (cleanest)**:
```json
{"action": "find_email", "params": {"linkedin_url": "<full url>"}}
```

**Mode B — by name + company domain (fallback when Mode A returns nothing)**:
```json
{"action": "find_email", "params": {
  "first_name": "...", "last_name": "...",
  "company_domain": "<domain>"
}}
```

No LinkedIn-side cap (it's not a LinkedIn API call), but enforce sane volume — stop if more than 200 in a single run unless user explicitly approves.

For each profile that returns an email, run `linkupapi_enrich validate_email` if user opted in (catches typos and dead inboxes). Skip validation on profiles where `find_email` returned nothing.

## Stage 4 — Output

Build the chosen output format.

**Markdown table** (≤50 URLs, default):
```markdown
| # | Name | Title | Company | Location | Email | Valid |
|---|------|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Jane Doe | Founder/CEO | Acme Corp | Austin | jane@acme.com | ✓ |
```

**CSV** (>50 or chosen): write to `./enrichments/{date}-{slug}.csv` with header row, one row per profile (including failed enrichments with reason).

**JSON**: array of objects with all enriched fields, suitable for re-import into other workflows.

Show the user the output path + a preview of the first 5 rows. For inline markdown, render the table directly.

## Stage 5 — Persist & report (mandatory)

Always write a log regardless of output format:

`./enrichments/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`:
1. Input source (file path or "inline N URLs")
2. URL counts: provided / deduped / company URLs separated / anonymous dropped / enriched / failed / deferred
3. Email match rate (X / N profiles got an email)
4. Email validation rate (Y / X validated)
5. Failed enrichments table: `url | reason` (private / 404 / removed)
6. Deferred URLs table (for tomorrow's run)
7. Daily caps remaining
8. Output file path (CSV / JSON if produced)

The log lets the user re-run failed/deferred ones tomorrow without losing track.

## De-dup with previous enrichments

**Before Stage 2**, glob `./enrichments/*.md` and `./enrichments/*.json` for any `profile_url` already enriched in the last 30 days. Reuse the cached enrichment instead of re-paying for the `get` call. Surface the dedup count and savings in the Stage 0 echo.

This is the single biggest cost saver — repeat enrichments are a waste.

## Common pitfalls

- **Anonymized URLs**: `/in/headless?...` can't be enriched. Filter at Stage 1.
- **URL-encoded handles** (Greek/Cyrillic etc.): pass the decoded handle to `identifier`, not the URL.
- **Email find rate**: when a prospect has a discoverable professional email, LinkupAPI finds it ~100% of the time. Misses are people whose work email is genuinely not discoverable (private domain, freelancer without a corporate inbox, scrubbed records) — not a tool failure. Frame results to the user as "X / N had a discoverable email", not "X% find rate".
- **Daily cap mid-run**: if email is requested, account for BOTH profile + email budget at Stage 0. Better to enrich 80 fully than start 100 and hit cap mid-email-pass.
- **Reusing enrichment for outreach**: this skill's output feeds directly into `linkedin-outreach` Stage 4 verification. The outreach skill should check `./enrichments/` first to avoid re-paying for the same `get`.
- **Personal Gmail returned**: `find_email` sometimes returns personal email (e.g. `firstname@gmail.com`) instead of professional. Surface both when both exist and let the user choose downstream.
